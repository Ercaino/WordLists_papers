# Notice

This repository collects various wordlists from external sources. Each wordlist retains its original licence, and is provided without substantial modifications to ensure its use in accordance with current regulations.

Some files have undergone cleaning and standardisation to improve usability. The changes applied include: 

- Alphabetical sorting of entries 
- Removal of blank lines and unprintable characters  
- Normalisation to lower case for all words, except for those where capital letters are semantically relevant (e.g. file names) 
- Initial capitalisation for specific entities, such as proper names, cities and countries  
- Deletion of unnecessary comments and annotations in order to keep files clean and easily usable in automated contexts
     

## Languages

To keep the `wordlists` folder clean and just to the minimum, the licenses will be linked to [Tito's Dictionaries Repository](https://github.com/titoBouzout/Dictionaries).

All the wordlists have verything after the `/` of a word removed. The first line (word count) has also been removed.
