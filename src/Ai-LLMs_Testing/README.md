# Large Language Models  (LLMs)

Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced AI systems built on transformer-based architectures, trained on vast and diverse textual datasets. These models demonstrate strong capabilities in understanding and generating natural language, with applications ranging from translation and text summarization to answering complex questions, code generation, and beyond.

Some of the most prominent LLMs include:

- GPT-3 / GPT-4  (developed by OpenAI)
- LaMDA  (by Google)
- Llama / Llama2 / Llama3  (released by Meta)
- Bloom  (an open-source model developed through international collaboration)
     

To systematically evaluate their cognitive, linguistic, and technical capabilities, structured prompts grouped into functional categories — often referred to as "Prompt Categories for Testing LLMs"  — are widely used. These categories typically cover:

- Contextual understanding 
- Logical or mathematical reasoning 
- Cross-lingual translation
- Coherent and structured text generation 
- Code writing (coding) and comprehension
- Open-ended questions requiring encyclopedic knowledge
- Handling ambiguity and inference
- Detection of bias and unsafe behavior

> These prompt types help assess how models perform in real-world scenarios, offering valuable insights into their reliability, robustness, and potential for responsible deployment. 

## Ethics and safety

Prompt Elicitation for Sensitive Content : targeted prompting techniques used to assess a model's propensity to generate potentially unethical, illegal, or harmful outputs, with the aim of evaluating its adherence to ethical guidelines, safety protocols, and usage policies.
