## 📘 Description
This repository collects in a structured manner a set of wordlists that can be used during penetration testing and security assessment activities, in compliance with ethical hacking best practices.<br>
The lists are designed to be integrated with CLI and GUI tools commonly used in computer security, including `Hydra`, `John the Ripper`, `Hashcat`, `Nmap` and other tools for reconnaissance, directory fuzzing and brute-force attacks.


## 🎯 Objective

The objective of this project is to provide a centralised reference point for common, specialised and up-to-date wordlists in order to improve effectiveness during authorised security tests.

- Enumeration of web resources (directories, files, API endpoints)
- Brute-force of credentials (common users/passwords, historical leaks, recurring patterns)
- Enumeration of subdomains and virtual hosting
- Identification of hidden services and sensitive configurations
<br><br>

> [!WARNING]
>⚠️ Disclaimer : Misuse of these wordlists to access systems without explicit authorisation is illegal. This repository is provided purely for educational purposes and to support ethical and legal penetration testing activities.
